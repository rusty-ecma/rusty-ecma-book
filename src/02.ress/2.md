# Building an IE8 Linter

$web-only$
To get started we need to add `ress` to our dependencies. This project is also going to need `serde`, `serde_derive` and `toml` because it will rely on a `.toml` file to make the list of unavailable tokens configurable.

```toml
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/Cargo.toml}}
```

Next we want to use the `Scanner` and `Token` from `ress`, we can do this by importing all the contents of the `prelude`.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:3}}
```

Since we are using a `.toml` file to provide the list of banned tokens, let's create a struct that will represent our configuration.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:11:17}}
```

The toml file we are going to use is pretty big so but if you want to see what it looks like you can check it out [here](../a.appendix/ie-8-banned.md). Essentially it is a list of identifiers, strings, punctuation, and keywords that would cause an error when trying to run in IE8.

To start we need to deserialize that file, we can do that with the `std::fs::read_to_string` and `toml::from_str` functions.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:20:21}}
```

Now that we have a list of tokens that should not be included in our javascript, let's get the js text. It would be useful to be able to take a path argument or read the raw js from stdin. This function will check for an argument first and fallback to reading from stdin, it looks something like this.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:43:60}}
```

we will call it like this.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:22:34}}
```

We want to handle the failure when attempting to get the js, so we will match on the call to `get_js`. If everything went well we need to check if the text is an empty string, this means no argument was provided but the program was not pipped any text. In either of these failure cases we want to print a nice message about how the command should have been written and then exit with a non-zero status code. `print_usage` is a pretty simple function that will just print to stdout the two ways to use the program.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:142:146}}
```

With that out of the way, we now can get into how we are going to solve the actual problem of finding these tokens in a javascript file. There are many ways to make this work but for this example we are going to wrap the `Scanner` in another struct that implements `Iterator`. First here is what that struct is going to look like.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:61:65}}
```

Before we get into the `impl Iterator` we should go over an `Error` implementation that we are going to use. It is relatively straight forward, the actual struct is going to be a tuple struct with three items. The first item is going to be a message that will include the token and type, the second and third are going to be the column/row of the banned token. We need to implement display (`Error` requires it) which will just create a nice error message for us.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:129:140}}
```

Now we can add a method to `BannedFinder` that will take an index and return the row/column pair.

Ok, now for the exciting part; we are going to `impl Iterator for BannedFinder` which will look like this.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:75:128}}
```

First we need to define what the `Item` for our `Iterator` is. It is going to be a `Result<(), BannedError>`, this will allow the caller to check if an item passed inspection. Now we can add the `fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>` definition. Inside that we first want to make sure that the `Scanner` isn't returning `None`, if it is we can just return `None`. If the scanner returns and `Result<Item, Error>` we first need to check that it is `Ok`, in this example we are just going to ignore the `Err` case. Once we have an actual `Item` we want to check what kind of token it is, we can do that by matching on `&item.token`.  We only care if the token is a `Keyword`, `Ident`, `Punct` or `String`, other wise we can say that the token passed. For each of these tokens we are going to check if the actual text is included in any of the `Vec<String>` properties of `self.banned`, if it is included we return a `BannedError` where the first property is a message containing the name of the token type and the text that token represents.

Now that we have all of the underlying infrastructure setup, let's use the `BannedFinder` in our `main`.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:34:40}}
```

That is pretty much it. If you wanted to see the full project you can find it in the [lint-ie8](https://github.com/FreeMasen/rusty-ecma-book/tree/master/lint-ie8) folder of this book's github repository.
