# Building a Writer
$web-only$
Thankfully because of the existence of `resw` completing the `console.log` debugging tool is going to be trivial. The primary entry point for `resw` is the `Writer` struct, which has a method `write_part` that will take a `&mut self` and `&ProgramPart`, so we can use that in our for loop to write out the parts as they are parsed. That might look like this.
<!-- main -->
```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:12:25}}
```

With that complete we can see how well it works for us. Let's use the following example JavaScript.

```js
function Thing(stuff) {
    this.stuff = stuff;
}
let x = new Thing('argument');
```

Just as a simple test we could enter the following into our terminal

```bash
$ echo "function Thing(stuff) {
    this.stuff = stuff;
}
let x = new Thing('argument');
" | console_logify
function Thing(stuff) {
    console.log('Thing', stuff);
    this.stuff = stuff;
}

let x = new Thing('argument');
```

That looks exactly like the output we were looking for. Let's double check that it will behave as expected by piping the output to `node`

```bash
$ echo "function Thing(stuff) {
    this.stuff = stuff;
}
let x = new Thing('argument');
" | console_logify | node -
Thing argument
```

It worked!
