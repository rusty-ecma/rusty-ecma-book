Before we get into how to use `ressa`, It is a good idea to briefly touch on the scope of a __parser__ or __syntax analyzer__. The biggest thing to understand is that we still are not dealing with the _semantic_ meaning of the program. That means `ressa` itself won't discover things like assigning to undeclared variables or attempting to call undefined functions because that would require more context. To that end, `ressa`'s true value isn't realized until it is embedded into another program that provide that context.

With that said `ressa` is providing a larger context as compared to what is provided by `ress`. It achieves that by wrapping the `Scanner` in a struct called `Parser`. Essentially `Parser` provides a way to keep track of what any given set of `Token`s might mean. `Parser` also implements `Iterator` over the enum `Result<ProgramPart, Error>`, the `Ok` variant has 3 cases representing the 3 different top level JavaScript constructs.

- `Decl` - a variable/function/class declaration
  - `Var` - A top level variable declaration e.g. `let x = 0;`
  - `Class` - A named class definition at the top level
  - `Func` - A named function definition at the top level
  - `Import` - An ES Module import statement
  - `Export` - An ES Module export statement
- `Dir` - A script directive, pretty much just 'use strict'
- `Stmt` - A catch all for all other statements
  - `Block` - A collection of statements wrapped in curly braces
  - `Break` - A break statement will exit a loop or labeled statement early
  - `Continue` - A continue statement will short circuit a loop
  - `Debugger` - the literal text `debugger`
  - `DoWhile` - A do loop executes the body before testing whether to continue
  - `Empty` - A single semicolon
  - `Expr` - A catch-all for everything else
  - `For` - A c-style for loop e.g. `for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) ;`
  - `ForIn` - A for loop that assigns the key of an enumerable at the top of each iteration
  - `ForOf` - A for loop that assigns the value of an iterable at the top of each iteration
  - `If` - A set of if/else if/else statements
  - `Labeled` - A statement that has been named by an attached identifier
  - `Return` - The return statement that resolves a function's value
  - `Switch` - A test `Expression` and a collection of `CaseStmt`s
  - `Throw` - The throw keyword followed by an `Expression`
  - `Try` - A try/catch/finally block for catching `Throw`n items
  - `Var` - A non-top level variable declaration
  - `While` - A loop which continues based on a test `Expression`
  - `With` - An antiquated statement that changes the order of identifier resolution

`Stmt` being the real work-horse of the group, while a top level function definition would be a `Decl`, a non-top level function definition would be a `Stmt`. Both `Decl` and `Stmt` themselves are enums representing the different possible variations. Looking further into the `Stmt` variants, you may notice there is another _catch all_ in the `Expr` variant which contains an `Expr` (expression) enum which defines an even more granular set of program parts.

- `Expr`
  - `Assign` - Assigning a value to a variable, this includes any update & assign operations e.g. `x = 1`, `x +=1`, etc
  - `Array` - An array literal e.g. `[1,2,3,4]`
  - `ArrowFunc` - An arrow function expression
  - `Await` - Any expression preceded by the `await` keyword
  - `Call` - Calling a function or method
  - `Class` - A class expression is a class definition with an optional identifier that is assigned to a variable or used as an argument in a `Call` expression
  - `Conditional` - Also known as the "ternary" operator e.g. `test ? consequent : alternate`
  - `Func` - A function expression is a function definition with an optional identifier that is either self executing, assigned to a variable or used as a `Call` argument
  - `Ident` - The identifier of a variable, call argument, class, import, export or function
  - `Lit` - A _primitive_ literal
  - `Logical` - Two expressions separated by `&&` or `||`
  - `Member` - Accessing a sub property on something. e.g. `[0,1,2][1]` or `console.log`
  - `MetaProp` - Currently the only `MetaProperty` is in a function body you can check `new.target` to see if something was called with the `new` keyword
  - `New` - A `Call` expression preceded by the `new` keyword
  - `Obj` - An object literal e.g. `{a: 1, b: 2}`
  - `Seq` - Any sequence of expressions separated by commas
  - `Spread` - the `...` operator followed by an expression
  - `Super` - The `super` pseudo-keyword used for accessing properties of a `super` class
  - `TaggedTemplate` - An identifier followed by a template literal [see MDN for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates)
  - `This` - The `this` pseudo-keyword used for accessing instance properties
  - `Unary` - An operation (that is not an update) that requires on expression as an argument e.g. `delete x`, `!true`, etc
  - `Update` - An operation that uses the `++` or `--` operator
  - `Yield` - the `yield` contextual keyword followed by an optional expression for use in generator function

Most of the `Expr`, `Stmt`, and `Decl` variants have associated values, to see more information about them check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/resast). There should be an example and description provided for each of the possible combinations.

With that long winded explanation of the _basic_ structure we are working with let's take a look at how we would use the `Parser`. In this example we have a javascript snippet that defines a function 'Thing', it will assign the first argument `stuff` to a property of the function `this.stuff`.

If we were to run the above we would get the following output.

If we walk through the output, we start by seeing that the

1. This program consists of a single part which is a  `ProgramPart::Decl`
2. Inside of that is a `Decl::Func`
3. Inside of that is a `Func`
   1. It has an `id`, which is an optional `Ident`, with the name of `Some("Thing")`
   2. It has a one item vec of `Pat`s in `params`
      1. Which is a `Pat::Identifier`
      2. Inside of that is an `Identifier` with the value of "stuff"
   3. It has a body that is a one item vec of `ProgramPart`s
      1. The item is a `ProgramPart::Stmt`
      2. Which is a `Stmt::Expr`
      3. Inside of that is an `Expr::Assign`
      4. Inside of that is an `AssignExpr`
         1. Which has an `operator` of `Equal`
         2. The `left` hand side is an `Expr::Member`
         3. Inside of that is a `MemberExpr`
            1. The `object` being `Expr::This`
            2. The `property` being `Expr::Ident` with the name of "stuff"
         4. The `right` hand side is an `Expr::Ident` with the name of "stuff"
         5. `computed` is false
   4. It is not a `generator`
   5. `is_async` is false

Phew! That is quite a lot of information! A big part of why we need to be that verbose is because of the "you can do anything" nature of JavaScript. Let's use the `MemberExpr` as an example, below are a collection of ways to write a `MemberExpr` in JavaScript.

```js
console.log;//member expr
console['log']; //member expr
const logVar = 'log';
console[logVar];//member expr
console[['l','o','g'].join('')];//member expr
class Log {
    toString() {
        return 'log';
    }
}
const logToString = new Log();
console[logToString];//member expr
function logFunc() {
    return 'log';
}
console[logFunc()];//member expr
function getConsole() {
    return console
}
getConsole()[logFunc()];//member expr
getConsole().log;//member expr
```

And with the way JavaScript has evolved this probably isn't an exhaustive list of ways to construct a `MemberExpr`. With the level of information `ressa` provides we have enough to truly understand the _syntactic_ meaning of the text. This will enable us to build more powerful tools to analyze and/or manipulate any given JavaScript program. With the pervasiveness of [print debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging#Techniques), wouldn't it be nice if we had a tool that would automatically insert a `console.log` at the top of every function and method in a program? We could make it print the name of that function and also each of the arguments, let's try and build one.
