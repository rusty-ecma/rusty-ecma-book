To get started building development tools using the Rust programming language, we are going to be utilizing 2 crates. The first is a crate called [`ress`](https://github.com/FreeMasen/RESS) or Rusty ECMAScript Scanner, this crate is used to convert JavaScript text into a series of `Token`s. Next is [`ressa`](https://github.com/FreeMasen/RESSA) or Rusty ECMAScript Syntax Analyzer, this crate will take that series of `Token`s and build an Abstract Syntax Tree or AST. Either of these tools will be useful for building development tools however since the output of `ress` is essentially flat it means we can only build a much simpler kind of tool. Over the course of this book we will dig into how to build a development tool with either of these crates.
